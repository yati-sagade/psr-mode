A minor mode for making OCR letter mistake mappings.

For example, let us suppose the original string that was OCRd was

    The quick brown fox jumps upon the lazy dog.

And the OCR result was

    The gaiek hiowii tox jumpa upoii the losy dog.

In order to correct this we first note that the first wrong string
is "ga" in "gaiek", which is supposed to be "qu"

Place the point on g, press `C-<Spc> ff` to select "ga" in the
region.

Now press C-c h

You will be prompted for a replacement string. Type qu <RET>

You should now see that the sentence has been changed to

    The <ga|qu>iek hiowii tox jumpa upoii the losy dog.

The next wrong letter is c in `quick` which was read as e in
`gaiek`. So place the point on the e and press `C-c h c<RET>` to get

    The <ga|qu>i<e|c>k hiowii tox jumpa upoii the losy dog.

Note that you don't need to create a region for a single letter
replacement - keeping the point on the letter and pressing C-c h
will work. For multi-letter mistakes, however, you need to select
the wrong string in a region and then press C-c h to provide the
replacement for that wrong string.

Continue this exercise to get the final result,

    The <ga|qu>i<e|c>k <hi|br>ow<ii|n> <t|f>ox jump<a|s> upo<ii|n>
    the l<os|az>y dog.
